# Python Variable Annotations Project

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the effective use of type annotations in Python. By implementing variable annotations, the project aims to enhance code readability, facilitate type checking during development, and minimize runtime errors. The project includes a series of tasks that progressively build on the concepts of type annotations.

## Features

- **Type Annotated Functions:** Functions within this project are fully annotated with explicit type hints for both arguments and return types.
- **Documentation:** Each module and function is documented with docstrings, explaining the purpose, parameters, and expected outcomes.
- **Testing:** Basic tests are provided to ensure the correctness of the functions according to the annotations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher (Type annotations are supported from Python 3.6 onwards)
- An IDE or text editor that supports Python
- (Optional) A type-checking tool like `mypy` to validate type annotations

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-variable-annotations.git
cd python-variable-annotations
```

## Usage

To run any script in the project, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
python3 name_of_the_script.py
```

To perform type checking using `mypy`:

```bash
mypy path_to_script.py
```

To perform PEP 8 style checking using `pycodestyle`:

```bash
pycodestyle path_to_script.py
```
